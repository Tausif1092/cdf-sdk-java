## Reading and writing data from/to Cognite Data Fusion

The Java SDK follows the Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) REST API structure. Both in terms of the different endpoints 
(`assets`, `events`, `contextualization`, etc.), the operations (`list`, `retrive`, `upsert`, etc.) and the 
data transfer objects (`asset`, `event`, etc.). Therefore, the [CDF REST API documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/) 
is an excellent foundation also for working with the Java SDK.
